# Insurance Risk & Pricing Engine

An institutional-grade insurance analytics framework designed to integrate actuarial modelling, machine learning, and economic optimisation within a unified research architecture.

---

## Overview

This project develops a cross-sectional insurance prediction engine analogous to quantitative equity modelling systems. The framework emphasises:

- Out-of-sample robustness  
- Stability-weighted model selection  
- Heavy-tailed risk modelling  
- Economic utility optimisation  
- Regulatory-aware capital simulation  

---

## Core Components

- Frequency modelling (Poisson, Negative Binomial, ML-based approaches)
- Severity modelling (Gamma, Lognormal, Tweedie)
- Pure premium estimation
- Fraud detection under cost-sensitive objectives
- Dynamic pricing with demand elasticity
- Capital adequacy simulation (99.5% VaR framework)

---

## Methodological Principles

- Expanding-window walk-forward validation  
- Strict separation of training and test sets  
- Cross-sectional ranking analysis  
- Profit-based evaluation metrics  
- Tail risk stress testing  

---

## Status

Initial development phase. Frequency modelling module in progress.
